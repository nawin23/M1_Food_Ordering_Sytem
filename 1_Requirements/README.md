## Introduction
In todayâ€™s age of fast food and take-out, many restaurants have chosen to focus on quick preparation and speedy delivery of orders rather than offering a rich dining experience. Until very recently, all of these delivery orders were placed over the phone, but there are many disadvantages to this system, including the inconvenience of the customer needing to have a physical copy of the menu, lack of a visual confirmation that the order was placed correctly, and the necessity for the restaurant to have an employee answering the phone and taking orders. What I propose is an online ordering system, originally designed for use in college cafeterias, but just as applicable in any food delivery industry. The main advantage of my system is that it greatly simplifies the ordering process for both the customer and the restaurant. When the customer visits the ordering webpage, they are presented with an interactive and up-to-date menu, complete with all available options and dynamically adjusting prices based on the selected options. After making a selection, the item is then added to their order, which the customer can review the details of at any time before checking out. This provides instant visual confirmation of what was selected and ensures that items in the order are, in fact, what was intended.
